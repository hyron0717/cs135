;; 3.
;; a.
;; Contract: Int Int Int -> Int
;; Purpose: determine the participation mark
;; Example:
(check-expect (participation-mark 100 25 25) 50)
(check-expect (participation-mark 32 24 0) 100)
;; Defination:
(define (participation-mark a b c)
  (cond [(>= b (* a 0.75)) 100]
        [else (* (/ (+ (* b 2) (* c 1)) (* a 2 0.75)) 100)]))
;; Test: 
(check-expect (participation-mark 100 0 0) 0)
(check-expect (participation-mark 50 50 0) 100)
(check-expect (participation-mark 100 50 50) 100)
