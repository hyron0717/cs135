;; Contrart: Num Num Num -> Boolean
;; Purpose: Determine the numbers whether is arithmetic sequence or not
;; Example: 
(check-expect (arith-seq-cond? 1 2 3) 'true)
(check-expect (arith-seq-cond? 5 7 9) 'true)
;;Defination:
(define (arith-seq-cond? a b c) 
  (cond [(= (- b a) (- c b)) 'true]
        [else 'false]))
;;Test:
(check-expect (arith-seq-cond? 9 7 5) 'true)
(check-expect (arith-seq-cond? 4 6 7) 'false)
